# Binary Search Tree Implementation in C++

This repository contains an implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure in C++. The main purpose of this implementation is to provide a basic understanding of how a binary search tree works and to demonstrate various operations that can be performed on it.

## Files

- `main.cpp`: This is the main C++ source file that contains a sample usage of the BinarySearchTree class. It demonstrates how to create a binary search tree, insert elements, and print the tree using different visualization techniques.

- `binarysearchtree.h`: This header file contains the implementation of the BinarySearchTree class, which represents the binary search tree data structure. It includes methods for insertion, erasing, finding, and visualization of the tree.

## Usage

To compile and run the example program, you can use any C++ compiler. For example, using g++:

```sh
g++ -o main main.cpp
./main
Features

    Insertion and deletion of key-value pairs.
    Finding values associated with specific keys.
    Tree visualization using various printing techniques.
    Demonstrates a basic implementation of a binary search tree.
